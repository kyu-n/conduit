# Conduit - The MCP Server for Phabricator and Phorge
Conduit is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that provides seamless integration with Phabricator and Phorge APIs, enabling advanced automation and interaction capabilities for developers and tools.

## Conduit
**Modern HTTP Client**: Built with `httpx` for HTTP/2 support and better performance

**MCP Integration**: Ready-to-use MCP tools for task management

**Type Safety**: Full type hints and runtime validation for better development experience

**Secure**: Token-based authentication with environment variable configuration

**Enhanced Features**:
- Advanced error handling with detailed error codes and suggestions
- Token optimization for efficient API responses
- Smart pagination and intelligent data limiting
- Runtime validation client for type safety
- Configurable client with caching and retry mechanisms

## Usage
### Via `uvx`
You need to install `uv` first. If it is not installed, run the following command:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
After installation, restart your shell or terminal to apply the environment variable changes.

Then run:
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/mcpnow-io/conduit conduit-mcp
```

### Team install (this fork)

This fork adds two read tools (`pha_file_download`, `pha_task_relationships`)
used by the `tackle` skill, on the `main` branch. It is a per-developer
server: each developer runs their own copy and authenticates with their own
Phorge API token. Nothing is shared except the code.

1. Each developer generates a token at `Settings -> Conduit API Tokens` on the
   Phorge instance and exports it:
   ```bash
   export PHABRICATOR_TOKEN=api-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   # exactly 32 chars
   ```
2. Copy [`.mcp.json.example`](.mcp.json.example) to `.mcp.json` at the root of
   the repo your team works in, replacing `<group>` with the real GitLab path.
   Claude Code auto-discovers it and prompts each developer to approve the
   server. The token is read from the environment via `${PHABRICATOR_TOKEN}`, so
   no secrets are committed.

The server pins to the `main` branch via
`git+https://your-git-host/<group>/conduit.git@main`.

### From Source
To install from source for development or contribution:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mcpnow-io/conduit.git
cd conduit

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This will install the package in editable mode with all development dependencies.

### Docker
We are still working on Docker support. We estimate it will be available soon.

### As HTTP/SSE Server
Conduit can run as an HTTP/SSE server for multi-user scenarios. This mode allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously, each using their own authentication tokens.

```bash
conduit-mcp --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
When running as an HTTP server, authentication tokens are provided via HTTP headers instead of environment variables.

```
X-PHABRICATOR-TOKEN: your-32-character-token-here
```

## Configuration
Before running the server, you need to set up the following environment variables:

### Environment Variables
```bash
export PHABRICATOR_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
export PHABRICATOR_URL="https://your-phabricator-instance.com/api/"

export PHABRICATOR_PROXY="socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"  # Optional, if your network is behind a firewall
export PHABRICATOR_DISABLE_CERT_VERIFY=1  # Optional, if your network is under HTTPS filter (WARNING: Disabling certificate verification can expose you to security risks. Only set this if you trust your network environment.)
export PHABRICATOR_USER_AGENT="MyOrg-Phabricator-MCP/1.0 (contact@example.org)"  # Optional, override the default User-Agent header. Some Phabricator/Phorge operators require identifying contact info for rate-limiting purposes.
```
Do note that in HTTPS/SSE mode, `PHABRICATOR_TOKEN` is NOT needed.

### Getting Your API Token
1. Log into your Phabricator instance
2. Go to Settings > API Tokens
3. Generate a new token
4. Copy the 32-character token and use it as `PHABRICATOR_TOKEN`
